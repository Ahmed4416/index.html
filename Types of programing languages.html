  C++ Language
The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects.
Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. 
The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times.This language is an efficient language.
But, many programmers will disagree

C Language
The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, 
particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++,
Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster .
However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.


Pascal Language
Pascal language is mostly a teaching language and few industries uses this language to write the programs. This language tends to use keywords instead of symbols and braces in C language.
So this language is very easy for beginners to understand than a programming language like C,
C++. Borland is a compiler software company, which is using Delphi programming language for industrial strength.
Delphi is an object oriented language of Pascal, and presently  Borland compilers only use it.

Java Language
The Java language is a multi platform language thatâ€™s particularly helpful in networking.
 Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However,
 this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax.
For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming.
Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, 
nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.
