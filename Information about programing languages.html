 Programming languages are the languages with which a programmer implements a piece of software to run on a computer,
The earliest programming languages were assembly languages, not far removed from the binary-encoded instructions directly executed by the computer.
 By the mid-1950s, programmers began to use higher-level languages.
Two of the first higher-level languages were FORTRAN (Formula Translator) and ALGOL (Algorithmic Language),
which allowed programmers to write algebraic expressions and solve scientific computing problems. 
 As learning to program became increasingly important in the 1960s, a stripped-down version of FORTRAN called BASIC (Beginner’s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was developed at Dartmouth College.
BASIC quickly spread to other academic institutions, and by 1980 versions of BASIC for personal computers allowed even students at elementary schools to learn the fundamentals of programming,Also, in the mid-1950s,
 COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) was developed to support business programming applications that involved managing information stored in records and files,
The trend since then has been toward developing increasingly abstract languages,
allowing the programmer to communicate with the machine at a level ever more remote from machine code.
 COBOL, FORTRAN, and their descendants (Pascal and C, for example) are known as imperative languages,
since they specify as a sequence of explicit commands how the machine is to go about solving the problem at hand,
These languages were also known as procedural languages, since they allowed programmers to develop and reuse procedures, 
subroutines, and functions to avoid reinventing basic tasks for every new application.
